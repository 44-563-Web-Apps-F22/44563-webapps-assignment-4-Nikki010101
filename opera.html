                ACT I—Exterior of Castle Bunthorne<br></h3>
                 <h4>

ACT I<br>
  [Scene:  Exterior of Castle Bunthorne, the gateway to which is
       seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawbridge over a moat.
       A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front
       of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELLA
       on her left.  Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are
       grouped about the stage from R. to L.C., SAPHIR being near
       the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
       they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.]<br>
                 No. 1. Twenty love-sick maidens we
                     (Opening Chorus and Solos)
                     Maidens, Angela, and Ella
                     </h4>
                    <pre> 
                     <b>ELLA</b>  The love of maidens is, to him, as interesting as the
                     taxes!
                   
                     <b>SAPHIR</b>  Would that it were!  He pays his taxes.
                   
                     <b>ANGELA</b>  And cherishes the receipts!
                   
                     [Enter LADY JANE, L.U.E.]
                   
                     <b>SAPHIR</b>  Happy receipts!  [All sigh heavily]
                   
                     <b>JANE</b> [L.C., suddenly] Fools!  [They start, and turn to her]
                   
                     <b>ANGELA</b>  I beg your pardon?
                   
                     <b>JANE</b>  Fools and blind!  The man loves — wildly loves!
                   
                     <b>ANGELA</b>  But whom?  None of us!
                   
                     <b>JANE</b>  No, none of us.  His weird fancy has lighted, for the
                     nonce, on Patience, the village milkmaid!
                    </pre>
