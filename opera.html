ACT I
<p class="direction"> [Scene:  Exterior of Castle Bunthorne, the gateway to which is
       seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawbridge over a moat.
       A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front
       of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELLA
       on her left.  Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are
       grouped about the stage from R. to L.C., SAPHIR being near
       the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
       they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.]</p>
